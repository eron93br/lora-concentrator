## Arduino-LMIC library (AU915 version)

This repository contains the IBM LMIC (LoraMAC-in-C) library, slightly modified to run in the AU915 standard with the  Arduino environment, allowing using the SX1272, SX1276 tranceivers and compatible modules (such as some HopeRF RFM9x modules).

The main changes were done in the [lorabase.h](https://github.com/eron93br/lora-concentrator/blob/master/src/lmic/lorabase.h) file.
